# Inventory file can have both the methods of either ssh using pem
#file or ssh using user name and password 
#ssh using pem is straight forward 
#ssh using password you need to make following chnages to client machine
#1) create username and password suing adduser command on client
#2) go to /etc/sshd/sshd_config file and enale password authentication =yes
#3)You are getting this error because when we do SSH in the remote system it will ask yes or no. 
#But Ansible doesn't have the capability to ask this in run time. 
#So you need to disable host_key_checking in your ansible.conf file as shown below.
# [root@localhost ~]# vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
# [defaults]
# inventory = /etc/hostfile.txt
# host_key_checking = False
#4) verify using  ansible all -m ping -i inventory
